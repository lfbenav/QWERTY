# QWERTY — Conversational Agent for PDF Document Analysis

QWERTY is an intelligent conversational agent designed to analyze and answer questions about class notes from the Artificial Intelligence course in PDF format.
It integrates RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and web search capabilities, enabling contextual, accurate, and memory-aware responses.

## Features
- Contextual Question Answering
Ask QWERTY about any concept or section from the uploaded course notes, and it will retrieve precise answers from the document database with their references.

- Conversational Memory
QWERTY remembers what you’ve asked within the same session — you can continue the conversation naturally.

- Web Search Integration
When needed, QWERTY can access the web to complement its responses with up-to-date information.

- Dual RAG Comparison
Implements two RAG pipelines with different text segmentation strategies to compare retrieval performance.
